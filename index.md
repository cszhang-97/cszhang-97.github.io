## Welcome to Chengshuo Zhang's Personal Page

I am current a graduate student majoring in Mathematics and Economics at University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.

Recently, I am interested in mathematical applications upon finance field, such as probability theory with measure theory,
mean field theory, stochastics calculus.
I am also excited about deploying computer science techniques and algorithms on real-life project.
